Our team has developed and maintained a number of projects over the years. Many of them are available under popular open source licenses. We invite UC Davis academic units to contact us for access or guidance in getting our software up and running.

### [Instructional Planning and Administration][IPA]
Academic course planning software. Enables visual editing of academic schedules by year and by term. Facilities communication between academic planners, instructors, management, and teaching assistants. Includes budget analysis.

### DSS Data Warehouse
RESTful JSON server designed for on-demand use. Used to enable access to campus data sources which themselves are either sensitive or not optimized for speed.

### [Roles Management][roles-management]
Access control software. Provides a streamlined interface to manage people and create automated groups which can then be assigned access to configurable endpoints. Natively supports LDAP and Active Directory; includes a scripting interface to extend available endpoints.

### [DSS Messenger][messenger]
Message broadcasting service with built-in follow-up templates. Designed to easily send out mass notices with verification. Useful for service outage and upgrade notices.

### [Wayfinding][wayfinding]
Developed with help from the UC Davis School of Law, Wayfinding is an interactive map, personnel, and event directory designed for deployment on building kiosks.

### [Chekhov][chekhov]
Templated checklists. Integrates with the ITIL [SysAid][sysaid] system.
